kaggle_bikesharing
==================

This is a practice to solve the Kaggle bikesharing competition using the caret package in R. Since the data is relatively clean and complete, only basic feature engineering is required, and I can focus on exploring different models integrated in caret. Through this practice, I have primarily gained knowledge to use caret and the machine learning techniques. 

So far, I have finished the [first half](https://rpubs.com/chengjiun/52658) of the report, which tried primarily tree models, and a little bit on GBM and random forest. The second half of the report is on going, which includes more exploration on random forest models, neural networks, and linear regression models. It will coming out soon, depending on my poor, slow, old, PC -- some of the models are too heavy to run, especially in R. 

Anyway, hopefully, the report here will also benefite others.
