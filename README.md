kaggle_bikesharing
==================

This is a practice to solve the Kaggle bikesharing competition using the caret package in R. Since the data is relatively clean and complete, only basic feature engineering is required, and I can focus on exploring different models integrated in caret. Through this practice, I am satisfied to earn the biggest prize of this competion -- the knowledge, and the experience to use caret and the machine learning models therein. 

So far, I have finished the [first half](https://rpubs.com/chengjiun/52658) of the report, which is about tree models, and a little bit on GBM and random forest. The second half of the report is on going, which includes more exploration on random forest models, neural networks, and linear regression models. It will come out soon (depending on when my poor, slow, old, PC could finish the jobs -- some of the models are too heavy to run, especially in R.). 

Hopefully, the report here will also benefite others.
